# Learning Python

This repository is aimed at teaching people interested in coding fundamentals. In this repository, I teach Python as it is the easiest for beginners and is becoming widely used, especially with the rise of Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence.

In this 'series' I will create Python notebooks for different topics and provide links to download them. These notebooks will contain in-depth details about the covered topics, some examples, and plenty of opportunities for people to write code. 

As each device is different there is no real guarantee that these Python notebooks will work right off the bat. I would recommend you download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download), an environment for coding in Python. This will enable you to get a seamless experience writing code and will make it easier to get to the root of the problem should it arise.
