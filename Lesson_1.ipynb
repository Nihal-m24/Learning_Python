    "Let‚Äôs imagine you have two types of toys: cars and plushes. You also have two containers with the labels: car and plush. You are cleaning your room and as you go through all your toys either place them in the car container or the plush container. That is literally what a variable is. A variable is a 'container' that stores a certain type of data, which we will get into in a bit, and makes it easier to use throughout the rest of your code. \n",

    "Variables also make it easier for you to manipulate and manage your data efficiently. You can add two variables together, store the sum of two numbers inside a variable, and a whole lot more. \n",

    "\n",
    "There are many different ways/standards of writing a variable in code. Each language that you use and learn has its convention when naming variables but you can typically use the way you are most comfortable with. In this section I will go over 2 conventions, one being the one used in Python and the other being my personal favorite.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* 1. Snake Case üêç: Python typically uses the convention called snake case. In this convention, the variable name is all lower case and each word is separated by an underscore '_'. \n",
    "ex: \"average_salary_nurses\". \n",
    "* 2. Camel Case üê´: Camel case is not typically used in Python. It is used in C-based languages such as C, C-Sharp, C#, C++, Swift, etc. I am including it here because it is what I use across all languages and feel most comfortable with it. To use this convention, you write the first word all in lowercase and each additional word will have its first letter capitalized. \n",
    "ex: averageSalaryDoctor\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the variable names in the examples above aren‚Äôt complete sentences. You only use small words and phrases to make the code easier to read. Remember we all code to avoid reading boring essays so save your fellow engineers time and a headache. Feel free to use any one of these conventions when writing your variables or if you use any other convention, let me know and use that. It‚Äôs all up to you. "

And just like integers, you can assign the answer to a mathematical operation to a double. In some languages, like in Python, doubles are called floats. In other languages, floats allow more decimal places than doubles. So for this series, I will use float and double interchangeably but be careful when working in other languages.  "

It outputs whatever you desire into the command line, or in this case, right below the cell. This helps you understand how your variables are being manipulated and what data they are storing at a given section of your code. They are not meant to be used as a debugging tool but many new programmers, including myself, treat them as such. Here the most basic way to call the print function is by writing print(). Inside the parenthesis would be the variable or message you are trying to print. A few different ways to use them and the different variations are:  "
